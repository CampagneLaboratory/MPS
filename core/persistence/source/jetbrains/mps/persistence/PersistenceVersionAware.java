/**
 * PROVISIONAL API
 *
 * Indicator for models that track version of model persistence.
 * Version set is specific to particular persistence, i.e. there might be range 1..8 for xml persistence and 1..2 for binary.
 * Model implementing this interface is not necessarily persisted with the version indicated, nor is persisted at all. It's possible to save
 * the same model with different persistence mechanisms, hence this version number is merely a hint and value tracker for persistence
 * implementations that do recognize versions, and is useless for others.
 *
 * Primary purpose of this interface is to break tight coupling of general MPS code with DefaultSModelDescriptor and DefaultSModel which
 * used to keep persistence version, and to get rid of <code>instanceof SDefaultModelDescriptor</code> (limite to particular model implementation).
 *
 * Generally, two models implementing this interface not necessarily share same persistence, thus <code>instanceof PersistenceVersionAware</code>
 * is not sufficient to tell persistence version values could be directly compared.
 * However, persistence version gets updated the model is read and written, and as such indicates version of the most recent (in case of
 * free-floating models) or default (for regular SModel with associated DataSource) persistence mechanism.
