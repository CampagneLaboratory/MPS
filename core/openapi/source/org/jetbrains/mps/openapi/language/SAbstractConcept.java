 * A descriptor of a concept, which defines the category for nodes.
 * The descriptor is read-only, it's impossible to change the concept by invoking its methods.
 * SConcept (and SAbstractConcept) can be obtained by id from SConceptRepository.
 * There's only one instance of each concept, so that they can be tested for equality with "==". [not yet completed].
 * note: the relationship between SNode and SConcept is very similar to relationship between an object and its Class object in Java
 * This interface is not supposed to be implemented outside of MPS itself.
 * Moreover, it's prohibited to have 2 or more implementations available on the classpath at a time.
 * This interface has been introduced to give MPS the ability to switch between different implementations w/o affecting users.
