Be specific about when a read and write action lock is needed.
Specify how to assert the required lock is present - ModelAccess.
Point to default implementations that can be build upon.

SModel should contain current SModel, SModelDescriptor, SModelHeader
references should not be resolvable by name
all classes are prefixed with "S"
ids are local and can't be obtained directly
references are global and can be obtained directly
L-parts are not reloadable, but hold reloadable entities inside of them

MODULE
    module is a vertex in a graph of dependencies

MODEL
    model is responsible for node ids inside of it
    model has a name

ROOT
    [a top-level node in model, that does not have a parent node - MM]
    a thing that can be opened in editor [a bit incorrect. A thing that is opened by default when
       user tries to edit something. Though programmatically any node can be opened in editor, see "Show type"
       dialog  - MM]
    a minimal thing that has own imports (models/languages) [not true for now, not true for future - MM]
    a miniamal thing to be persisted [not true. model is a minimal thing to be persisted - MM]
    a maximal thing to be generated as a whole (not absolute truth)
